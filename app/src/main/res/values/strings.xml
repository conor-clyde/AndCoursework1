    <string name="txt_declare">This game was developed as an assignment for my Advanced Mobile Technology module. The goal of the game is to be keep throwing a set of five dice, adding the value of your throws together until you are able to reach a goal. However, if the computer player reaches the goal before you, you lose. You are allowed up to three dice throws per turn but within those three rolls, you must score your throw to add it to your current score. The game is explained as it goes via instructions at the top of the game screen. Please enjoy the game!</string>
